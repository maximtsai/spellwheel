To run this game, first start a local server in this folder.

If you are using Windows, you can open runServer8124.exe to start a local server. You can access the local server by going to localhost:8124 in a web browser.

The (second) easiest way to do so is to install python. Instructions on doing so can be found here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server 

Once you have python installed, you can click on pythonRunServer.bat or python3RunServer.bat (depending on which version of python you've installed). The bat file is pointing to port 8124 and you can open it by going to localhost:8124 in a web browser.
